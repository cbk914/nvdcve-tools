# nvdcve-tools
Some python tools to manage and search on CVE databases

# Tools installation

* Download the repo:

  git clone https://github.com/cbk914/nvdcve-tools.git

# To install and run in virtual environment

* Excute env.sh script

  ./env.sh

* Install required libraries:
The script uses the requests, os, and hashlib libraries. To install these libraries, open a terminal and run the following command:

  pip3 install -r requirements

* To download the NVD CVE databases, type:

  python3 get-nvdcve.py
  
* Specify a year (optional):
If you only want to download data for a specific year, use the -y or --year option followed by the year in the format YYYY. For example:
yaml

  python3 get-nvdcve.py -y 2020

This will download only the data for the year 2020. By default, the script downloads data for all years.

# TO-DO

* Search option (CVE, CVSS, product, version)
